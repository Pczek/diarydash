		<h2>Welcome to DiaryDash</h2>
		<p>
			This is Diary Dash, a dashboard website for your daily diary entry. This is not meant to replace your personal vacation diary, it is build for your 'Morning Pages'. Remove the 		clutter from your head by typing them out. Ramble out your toughts so they don't stand in your way of creative thinking.

		synchronize the day at hand. Do not over-think Morning Pages [...]
